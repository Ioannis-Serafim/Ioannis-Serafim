- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development and Software Engineering
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS as well as Java
- ðŸ“« You can reach me either on my instagram: ioa_serafim or on my E-Mail: ioannis.serafim@outlook.com
- ðŸ“‘ I already finished one of my Websites for a school project, in which I used HTML/CSS/JS/PHP. You can look it up here: 
  http://fesmoj.bplaced.net/pe/webeditor/workspace/j23_SerafinIoannis/Projekt_WF/landingpage.php
  Furthermore I took part in creating the website of <a href="miteinanderleben.de" target="_blank">miteinanderleben e.V.</a> with wordpress as part of a seminar course during my graduation from High School.
  Currently I'm working on an eCommerce Page, but this will take at least another two months to finish.
